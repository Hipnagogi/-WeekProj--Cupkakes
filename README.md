############     Weekly Project #1     ############   

You're working with an accountant named Arthur.

Arthur has a client, Matilda.  Matilda is 68 years old and sells cupcakes.  Matilda is not a big fan of spreadsheets, accounting software, or computers in general really.

Every so often Matilda sends Arthur three files:

Basic.txt, Delux.txt, and Total.txt

Naturally, as any savvy business owner, Matilda wants to understand her business.  So she sends Arthur those files and wants to know: 
  # "How much money did I make last year? 
  # How much money do I make in a typical month?  

These documents never have dates, each line was entered on a different day.  
The bottom-most row is always 'Today', the row above that is 'Yesterday', and so on.

The files are always lined up perfectly, you never have to worry about them being 'out of sync' or anything like that.
Basic.txt is the number of basic cupcakes she sold on that day, and they cost $5.  
Deluxe.txt is the number of Deluxe cupcakes (they have sprinkles!) sold on that day, and they cost $6.  
Total.txt is the total money she made (let's not even think about taxes yet, ugh).

Matilda every so often wants to know:
  # Yearly Revenue Totals
  # Monthly Revenue Totals
  # Weekly Revenue Totals
